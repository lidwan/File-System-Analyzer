# File-System-Analyzer
A File System Analyzer? Scannes directories, breaks down disk usage, detects duplicate files, and has a GUI with charts to better visualize information, and much more!
## Still a work in progress
currently, the code can do the following:
- scan a dictionary
- store each file name (full absolute path) and the file's size
- extract the extension of each file
- store each extension type and the total size of all files using that extension
- detect duplicate files using their hashcodes
- store each file and its hashcode
- store each hashcode and a list of all files with that hashcode (all duplicate files).
## What's next?
- exporting results (w/ custom results)
- Nice GUI
- Charts to visualize data
- the ability to delete duplicate files
